Ideaz:
Basilisk: Melee attacks have a small chance to be immediately fatal.
-- Lamp, passive glow around player
-- Medal, when player uses this artifact he gains passive psy health regeneration. That is if medal is turned with the right pole. From time to time player would need to turn artifact to not go insane.
-- Death Lamp, player can use this artifact to hit enemies in a short radius at the cost of his health. Cooldown - 2 hours
Lucifer artefact: Equipping it makes you grant powerful stats, but the artefact slowly degrades. Find more artefacts to prolong your life or face the consequences
lighthouse - is it possible to see who's in your flashlight cone if it's on?

Artefact that gives significant buff to psy regen but makes you do crazy shit

Sandstone, perk: Zone Infusion
Stepping into anomaly of various types infuse your active weapon and changes its damage type according to the anomaly type
Effect lasts for 5 real minutes
DOes not stack in any way
