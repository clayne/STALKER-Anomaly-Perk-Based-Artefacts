Arts to do:
Bat
Monolith Shard (if needed)
Chain (will be Sin exclusive artefact, not programmed yet)
Lamp
Lighthouse
Medalion
Moss
Moon (WIP, wanna make effect more interesting than just an opposite of Sun)
Thistle
Scar (Crazy stalker artefact)

Ideaz:
Basilisk: Melee attacks have a small chance to be immediately fatal.
-- Lamp, passive glow around player
-- Medal, when player uses this artifact he gains passive psy health regeneration. That is if medal is turned with the right pole. From time to time player would need to turn artifact to not go insane.
-- Death Lamp, player can use this artifact to hit enemies in a short radius at the cost of his health. Cooldown - 2 hours
Lucifer artefact: Equipping it makes you grant powerful stats, but the artefact slowly degrades. Find more artefacts to prolong your life or face the consequences
lighthouse - is it possible to see who's in your flashlight cone if it's on?

Artefact that gives significant buff to psy regen but makes you do crazy shit

5 shots or 6
there is 50% chance that last shoy in the mag will not consume ammo

Moss, Perk: Culinary Hyperversity
Eating raw uncooked mutant meat grants you temporary change of stats
The degree of bonuses varies, mutant parts can give boost to some stats and give penalty to others
Extra artefacts and eating same part multiple times does not stack the effect
Effect lasts for 1 minute
Eating different mutant meat overrides previous effect and reset the timer

Medallion, perk: Golden rain
Roubles will drop from the sky right on top of your head
Unfortunately it's kinda painful and shameful so you will get 5% of health and 10% of psy damage on each occurrence
