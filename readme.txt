Perk Based Artefacts, 0.02
A unique twist on overhauling old junk artefacts beyond the boundaries of simple stat changers
Junk artefacts are no longer junk and received unique properties or Perks. The degree of perks vary from simple boosters to marvellous staff like recharging batteries by stepping in Electra, receiving Money on Headshots or Even Evading Death itself when all hope is lost.
Multiple artefacts might or might not stack the effects and penalties of Perks in various ways, and effects are triggered on very various conditions

This is very first test versions to see the first problems, bugs and compatibility issues. The descriptions of artefacts aren't changed and no balancing of their prices, tiers or relations to usual artefacts were performed. Not all artefacts are affected and their Perks are a subject to change many times

So far the perks are

  -- Sun, gives health and stamina boost at clear weather, little stamina boost at partly clear and stamina penalty at not clear and at night
  -- Effect stacks with each artefact on belt

  -- Heart, Perk: Will to Live
  -- Gives stronger health regen the less health you have if you have lower than 30% of health up to that amount
  -- More artefacts increase the regen and slightly increases the highest health to trigger

  -- Moon, increases stats after midnight until dawn, gives penalties at day time (WIP)
  -- Effect stacks with each artefact on belt

  -- Signet, restores health and psy while being near campfire, amplifies psy recovery artefacts near campfire
  -- Effect stacks with each artefact on belt
