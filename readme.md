# Perk Based Artefacts 2.0
A unique twist on overhauling old junk artefacts beyond the boundaries of simple stat changers.

All 30+ Junk artefacts are no longer junk and received unique special abilities or Perks. The degree of perks vary from simple boosters to marvellous staff like recharging batteries by stepping in Electra, receiving Money on Headshots or Even Evading Death itself when all hope is lost.
Multiple artefacts might or might not stack the effects and penalties of Perks in various ways, and effects are triggered on very various conditions.

The mod comes with FULL and LITE versions. FULL version balances out some usual artefacts stats, primarily bullet/rupture-proof and carry weight artefacts to make new artefacts shine more. This is the intended way to use the mod. LITE version doesn't touch vanilla configs and maximum compatible with other mods that touch artefacts
