			You signed a Pact with the Zone. You are being rewarded with amazing abilities in exchange for your life force. To prevent your demise and prolong your existence, you are given a chance to sacrifice other Zone's riches. The quality of the offering matters as you will be compensated appropriately. Do not slack off and remember - the clock is ticking.\n \n
			%c[d_orange]Perk: The Lucifer Effect\n 
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Lucifer grants you immense strength and abilities, making you a demigod\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]At max condition you receive:\n
			%c[ui_gray_2]      - %c[d_cyan]50%%c[ui_gray_2] reduction of any damage\n
			%c[ui_gray_2]      - %c[d_cyan]35%%c[ui_gray_2] increase in speed\n
			%c[ui_gray_2]      - %c[d_cyan]1%/sec%c[ui_gray_2] health regen\n
			%c[ui_gray_2]      - %c[d_cyan]5%/sec%c[ui_gray_2] psy regen\n
			%c[ui_gray_2]      - %c[d_cyan]+50kg%c[ui_gray_2] of carry weight\n \n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Lucifer will always work even from the backpack \n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]However, your powers are very short-lived (about 4 days) and drain artefact energy\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]With each % of energy loss your powers will be weaker\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]At 50% you will have no powers\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Less than 50% the artefact will start to consume your soul to live resulting first in slight loss of stamina\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Less than 40% and your health start to disappear, first slow, then increasing with decrease of condition\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]You can sacrifice mere usual artefacts to partially restore Lucifer's condition\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Tier 1 artefacts restore 3-5%\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Tier 2 artefacts restore 6-9%\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Tier 3 artefacts restore 10-13%\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Extra Knot artefacts restore 20-30%\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Seraphim can't be sacrificed\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Death Lamp will overcharge artefact, restoring it to 100% and temporarily boosting it even more\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]There is a slight chance that overcharging with Death Lamp will tear you apart\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]You cannot dispose the artefact by any means\n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Lucifer has unknown influence on other artefacts, enhancing their effects in various ways \n
			%c[ui_white]  • %c[d_orange]Find more artefacts to restore Lucifer's condition or face the consequences\n
