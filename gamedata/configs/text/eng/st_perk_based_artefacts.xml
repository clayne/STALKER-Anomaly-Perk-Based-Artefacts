			The mysterious artefact, giving its wielder enormous powers but at big cost\n\n
			%c[d_orange] • %c[d_orange] Perk: The Lucifer Effect\n 
	        -- Lucifer grants you immense strength and abilities, making you a demigod\n

			--   50% reduction of any damage\n
			--   35% increase in speed\n
			--   1%/sec health regen\n
			--   5%/sec psy regen\n
			--   +50kg of carry weight\n
			-- Lucifer will always work even from the backpack \n
			-- However, your powers are very short-lived (about 4 days) and drain artefact energy\n
			-- With each % of energy loss your powers will be weaker\n
			-- At 50% you will have no powers\n
			-- Less than 50% the artefact will start to consume your soul to live resulting first in slight loss of stamina\n

			-- Tier 3 artefacts restore 10-13%\n
			-- Extra Knot artefacts restore 20-30%\n
			-- Seraphim can't be sacrificed\n
			-- Death Lamp will overcharge artefact, restoring it to 100% and temporarily boosting it even more (WIP)\n
			-- There is a slight chance that overcharging with Death Lamp will tear you apart\n
			-- You can not dispose the artefact by any means\n
			-- Lucifer has unknown influence on other artefacts, enhancing their effects in various ways \n
			-- Find more artefacts to restore Lucifer's condition or face the consequences\n
